use in parallel plan execution.
Read more about max degree of parallelism in this article
[Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189094.aspx)

#### Formula for dynamically allocating max degree of parallelism

* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server equals 1, then
  max degree of parallelism is calculated using number of cores divided in 2
  (numberOfCores / 2), then rounded up to the next integer (3.5 > 4).
* If the number of cores configured in SQL Server are greater than or equal to
  8 cores then max degree of parallelism will be set to 8.
* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server is greater than
  2 and the number of cores are less than 8 then max degree of parallelism will
  be set to the number of cores.

pool used by the instance of SQL Server
The default setting for minimum server memory is 0, and the default setting for
maximum server memory is 2147483647 MB.
Read more about minimum server memory and maximum server memory in this article
[Server Memory Server Configuration Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178067.aspx).

#### Formula for dynamically allocating maximum memory

The formula is based on the [SQL Max Memory Calculator](http://sqlmax.chuvash.eu/)
website. The website code is in the sql-max GitHub repository maintained by [@mirontoli](https://github.com/mirontoli).
The dynamic maximum memory (in MB) is calculate with this formula:
SQL Max Memory = TotalPhysicalMemory - (NumOfSQLThreads\*ThreadStackSize) -
(1024\*CEILING(NumOfCores/4)) - OSReservedMemory.

##### NumOfSQLThreads

* If the number of cores is less than or equal to 4, the number of SQL threads
  is set to: 256 + (NumberOfCores - 4) \* 8.
* If the number of cores is greater than 4, the number of SQL threads is set
  to: 0 (zero).

##### ThreadStackSize

* If the architecture of windows server is x86, the size of thread stack is 1MB.
* If the architecture of windows server is x64, the size of thread stack is 2MB.
* If the architecture of windows server is IA64, the size of thread stack is 4MB.

##### OSReservedMemory

* If the total physical memory is less than or equal to 20GB, the percentage of
  reserved memory for OS is 20% of total physical memory.
* If the total physical memory is greater than 20GB, the percentage of reserved
  memory for OS is 12.5% of total physical memory.

SQL Server 2012 failover cluster](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2547273/you-cannot-add-or-remove-features-to-a-sql-server-2008,-sql-server-2008-r2,-or-sql-server-2012-failover-cluster).

#### Credentials

##### PsDscRunAsCredential

If PsDscRunAsCredential is set, the installation will be performed with those
credentials, and the user name will be used as the first system administrator.

##### SYSTEM

If PsDscRunAsCredential is not assigned credentials then installation will be
performed by the SYSTEM account. When installing as the SYSTEM account, then
parameter SQLSysAdminAccounts and ASSysAdminAccounts must be specified when
installing feature Database Engine and Analysis Services respectively.

#### Parameters

* **`[String]` Action** _(Write)_: The action to be performed. Defaults to 'Install'.
  *Note: AddNode is not currently functional.*
  { _Install_ | InstallFailoverCluster | AddNode | PrepareFailoverCluster |
   CompleteFailoverCluster }
* **`[String]` InstanceName** _(Key)_: SQL instance to be installed.
* **`[String]` SourcePath** _(Write)_: The path to the root of the source files for
  installation. I.e and UNC path to a shared resource. Environment variables can
  be used in the path.
* **`[PSCredential]` SourceCredential** _(Write)_: Credentials used to access the
  path set in the parameter `SourcePath`. Using this parameter will trigger a
  copy of the installation media to a temp folder on the target node. Setup will
  then be started from the temp folder on the target node. For any subsequent
  calls to the resource, the parameter `SourceCredential` is used to evaluate what
  major version the file 'setup.exe' has in the path set, again, by the parameter
  `SourcePath`. To know how the temp folder is evaluated please read the online
  documentation for [System.IO.Path.GetTempPath()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.gettemppath(v=vs.110).aspx).
  If the path, that is assigned to parameter `SourcePath`, contains a leaf folder,
  for example '\\server\share\folder', then that leaf folder will be used as the
  name of the temporary folder. If the path, that is assigned to parameter
  `SourcePath`, does not have a leaf folder, for example '\\server\share', then
  a unique GUID will be used as the name of the temporary folder.

##### Severe known issues

This is a list of known issues that severely impact the use of the resource.

There are currently no known severe issues.

### xWaitForAvailabilityGroup

This resource will wait for a cluster role/group to be created. This is used to
wait for an Availability Group to create the cluster role/group in the cluster.

>Note: This only evaluates if the cluster role/group has been created and when it
found it will wait for RetryIntervalSec a last time before returning. There is
currently no check to validate that the Availability Group was successfully created
or that it has finished creating the Availability Group.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server Database Engine 2012 or later.
* Target machine must have access to the Failover Cluster PowerShell module.

#### Security Requirements

* The account running this resource must have permission in the cluster to be able
  to run the cmdlet Get-ClusterGroup.

#### Parameters

* **`[String]` Name** _(Key)_: Name of the cluster role/group to look for (normally
  the same as the Availability Group name).
* **`[Uint64]` RetryIntervalSec** _(Write)_: The interval, in seconds, to check for
  the presence of the cluster role/group. Default value is 20 seconds. When the
  cluster role/group has been found the resource will wait for this amount of time
  once more before returning.
* **`[Uint32]` RetryCount** _(Write)_: Maximum number of retries until the resource
  will timeout and throw an error. Default value is 30 times.

#### Read-Only Properties from Get-TargetResource

* **`[Boolean]` GroupExist** _(Read)_: Returns $true if the cluster role/group exist,
  otherwise it returns $false. Used by Get-TargetResource.

#### Examples

* [Wait for a cluster role/group to be available](/Examples/Resources/xWaitForAvailabilityGroup/1-WaitForASingleClusterGroup.ps1)
* [Wait for multiple cluster roles/groups to be available](/Examples/Resources/xWaitForAvailabilityGroup/2-WaitForMultipleClusterGroups.ps1)
